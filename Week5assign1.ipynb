    "Syntax Errors: Syntax errors occur when the syntax of the code violates the rules of the Python language. These errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase, before the code is executed. Syntax errors indicate that the code is not written correctly and cannot be compiled or interpreted. They commonly occur due to missing or incorrect syntax elements like incorrect indentation, missing parentheses, or misspelled keywords. Syntax errors need to be fixed before the code can be executed.\n",

Exceptions can be caused by various situations, including invalid input, division by zero, accessing non-existent resources, or errors in the underlying logic of the program."

    "Specific Error Handling: Custom exceptions allow you to handle specific errors or exceptional conditions in a more granular and meaningful way. Instead of relying solely on general exception classes, you can create custom exceptions that capture the specific context or nature of the error, providing more informative error messages or allowing for targeted exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity and Reusability: By creating custom exceptions, you can encapsulate error handling logic within the exception class itself. This promotes modularity and code reusability, as you can raise and catch the custom exception in different parts of your codebase without duplicating the error handling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability and Maintainability: Custom exceptions make your code more readable and maintainable. By using descriptive and self-explanatory exception names, it becomes easier for other developers to understand the purpose or reason behind the raised exception. Additionally, when you encounter a custom exception during debugging or error tracing, the exception's name provides valuable information about the error source."
