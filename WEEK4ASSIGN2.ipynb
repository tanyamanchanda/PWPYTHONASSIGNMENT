    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), self is a conventionally used parameter name that refers to the instance of a class. It is a reference to the current object on which a method is being called.\n",
    "Object Context: In OOP, methods are defined within classes to operate on the attributes and behavior of objects. The self parameter allows a method to access and manipulate the instance variables (attributes) of the object it is called on. It provides a way to refer to the specific instance of the class that the method is being called on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute Access: By using self, methods can access and modify the attributes of an object. When an attribute is accessed or modified within a method using self.attribute_name, it ensures that the correct attribute of the current object is being referred to. This allows for proper encapsulation and the ability to work with object-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method Invocation: Using self, methods can be invoked on an object by calling self.method_name(). It allows the method to be executed within the context of the object it belongs to, enabling the method to access and manipulate the object's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiating Instance and Local Variables: self helps differentiate between instance variables and local variables within a method. Instance variables are accessed using self.attribute_name, while local variables are accessed without self. This distinction is crucial to avoid variable shadowing and ensure that the correct variable is being accessed."
